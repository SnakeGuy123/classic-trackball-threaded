The files in each "Revision" directory are designed to work with each other. For instance, all of the files in Revision A are designed to work as a unit.

**NOTE** that even though a Revision is marked with a letter, not all of the parts have this letter. For instance, in Revision D, the buttons are actually marked with a C. This is intentional.

Files in this directory are common to all revisions.
